# QuickMath

Welcome to the official repository of QuickMath! QuickMath is a simple calculator, simple to use but with some (hopefully a lot in the future) cool features, like:

• Ability to save calculations and to restore them

• Support for BIG numbers

• Keyboard Shortcuts

• Variable Support

I'm also working on adding 2D and 3D graphs, and an equation solver.

This calculator uses the C++ Mathematical Expression Toolkit Library (ExprTk Link Here: http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/) so all functions available in the parser are also supported in QuickMath.

The first distribution is available in the Release tab, be sure to check it out! 
And if you wanna build QuickMath from scratch you need to include extrenal libraries (mpir,mpfr,exprtk,exprtk_mpfr_adaptor) with their relative header (.h) and library (.lib) files. For legal reasons I don't want to include them in this repository.

The test project is nothing important it is only useful for me to test out potentially new features separately from the main program code.
